      <h3> This is a project where I made a website about my favorite movie or about a movie that I just recently saw. I chose The Secret
    Life Of Pets! I used CSS properties, Bootstrap and fool around with HTML. This is one of my favorites because I think that it's really
  pretty and I spent a lot of time making it. I'm really proud of it! ;)</h3>

      <h3> This is a project where I had to experiment the different CSS properties. I took my name
      and experimented with colors, fonts, borders, backgrounds etc. It was a really fun project!
    I like it because it was fun to create and I think it's cute. ;)</h3>

    <h3> This website was supposed to be a project proposal but the next day I didn't want to make this website anymore
        because I thought that it was a stupid idea. So I just like the CSS properties that I used in this website. ;)</h3>
