  <h2> 3️⃣Third entry: 3/29/17</h2>
  <h3> Landed sefely in Poland</h3>
  <h2> 4️⃣Fourth entry: 3/30/17</h2>
  <h3> Since we were staying at Viola's <span>(my cousin)</span> house, today was the day to get back to <span> Białystok</span> and start shopping for new clothes.
   Grandma and I woke up around 7AM which is 1AM in the morning in New York. We ate breakfast and then checked when there would be a train that would take us home.
 We found out that there would be a train leaving from Viola's town train station that we would then have to transfer to the train taking us home. We said our goodbyes
  and then transfered to the final train. It took us about two hours and we arrived at our destination safe and sound. We walked home talking and laughing the whole way.
After we ate and I unpacked partially <span>(since the airline lost my luggage)</span> we went to the mall to see if there were any clothes that we could buy.
We found a pair of shorts and a T-shirt.

<h2> 5️⃣Fifth entry: 3/31/17</h2>
<h3> Today was my first rehabilitation meeting with a new woman. But before that we needed to go shopping to get some clothes. So we went to this mall in the city
"Atrium Biała". There we found a camo T-shirt, a pair of white overallls, a gray croptop, an army green T-shirt, a ring with wings, and a Cali takntop. Then after
our shopping spree we went back home to drop off the clothes and then quickly make our way over there. We got there and met the woman and she said almost the same
thing that the woman I worked with last year. So she started massaging and gave me some exersices. Then we walked halfway home.

<h2> 7️⃣Seventh entry: 4/2/17</h2>
<h3> Today was my second visit with Ula <span> (physiotherapist)</span> and we kept working. After that we came back home and Ewa came with Basia. Grandma and Ewa <span>(my aunt)</span>
Then grandma and Ewa went to the store 'cause they felt like we had to catch up, and so we did. We talked, laughed, danced, sang and then I introduced her to <span> Fidget Spinners</span>
She was absolutely fascinated! After Grandma and Ewa came I went for a run with the dog, then I went for a bike ride and then did my exercises. While I was doing my exercises Maciek
<span>(my cousin)</span> came over to say hi and brag about his math class.</h3>
<h2> 8️⃣Eighth entry: 4/3/17</h2>
<h3> Today Basia came to us and spent the whole day with us. Grandma took us to the pool with a goal of teaching Basia how to swim, and that's what we did. The big sports pool was closed so we went
down to the small pool and jacuzzis and saunas. I was swimming around while grandma put a macaroni around her and was introducing her to water. She was telling her how bodies in water work.
She was a bit scared at first but then she noticed that I was swimming so she felt a little better after knowing that she wouldn't be able to drown. So we began swimming around the pool. After we got
tired we went to the jacuzzi and then to the sauna. We then went home. Since there is constuction of a road right in front of our house. Because of the construction there are giant hills and mountains
made of sand. We went outside with the dog and played this game of who can climb the most mountains in the shortest amount of time. We weren't really counting points but it was still fun. Today was
the day that my luggage came back. We unpacked and had a mini fashion show of my too small clothes on Basia <span>(my cousin)</span> We then had a picnic/tanning session. While of course listening to some
music and munching on some ice cream. It was a great day! Can't wait for next week when we do it again.
