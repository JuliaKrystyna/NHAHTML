         <h2> Blog about my summer adventure</h2>
         <h2> First entry:</h2>
         <h3> When my mom was buying the tickets it turned out that she couldn't pay for the stewardess escort.
            So I would have to transfer in Berlin to another plane. I was a nervous but I tried not to show it, I even said that
            it's easier than riding the subway because I didn't have to look for my stop to get off. But then I got really nervous that I was going to get
            lost in Berlin and I wouldn't be able to communicate because they talk in German. Then the big day came..... It was time to check in and get
            my boarding pass. The pit in my stomach kept getting bigger the closer we got. When we got to the booth The woman asked me how old I was
            and asked if I was sure that I wanted to travel by myself. I didn't want to so my mom payed for the escort and I felt better. I didn't know
            what was actually awaiting ahead.
         </h3>
         <h2> Second entry: 3/28/17</h2>
         <h3>Today is the big day. The day when I leave to Poland and it's also Avia's <span>(only the coolest girl that I know and my best friend)</span>
           Birthday and her party. Because of her party my mom got tickets that were later in the day so that I could make it for both.
           Avia and I have matching Stitch onesies. Her party was at a Karaoke place, I had to take all my luggage into the city with me and just go to the
           airport after the party. Halfway to the Karaoke place I remembered that I forgot my phone charger, my pillowcase, and Eeyore. So I had to go back home,
           I ran. I got the things and then got in the 4 train and rode to Union Square. I got to the Karaoke place and we all sang, ate, laughed
           and had so much fun. I'm going to miss all of them so much.<span> (especially AVIA)</span> Before we knew it, time was up and it was time to go
           I said goodbye to everyone and hugged Avia, I met my mom then we started heading to JFK. We got to JFK and it was so dark in the airport and
           a really long line for check-in. As I said before when we got to the check-in booth the lady asked my mom if she was sure that she wanted
           to let me go alone. So my mom payed for the stewardess last minute. <span>(thankfully)</span>
         </h3>
         <h3> While my mom was filling out all the papers I went to the bathroom to change my shoes and my clothes so that I can be comfy for the
           flight. While <span>(Idk why I'm saying while so many times)</span> we were waiting for somebody to take me to the airplane mom and I were talking and
           making jokes about what UM means. We came up with Unwanted Minor. <span>(funny right?)</span> We were laughing how I was <span> UNWANTED</span>
           and she was sending me to <span>THE GRANDPARENTS</span>! At last it was time, it was time to say
           goodbye to mom and head through security and to the plane. The plane ride was <span>REALLY LONG</span>!
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Finally we landed in Berlin and it was time to transfer to the other plane. Since I was an <span>Unwanted Minor</span> I was the last
          person off the plane. I was handed off to this woman that stank like cigarettes and her teeth were all rotted. She didn't a word of English
          or Polish, she kept talking to me in German and then asking me "No, Deutsch?" I would always say the same thing, which was no but she didn't seem to get it.
          She then got some person to tell me that my flight was delayed half an hour. When that guy told me that it was delayed by <span> half an hour</span>
          so I thought that it was actually <span> half an hour</span> not <span> FIVE HOURS!!</span> The plane that I was supposed to take was delayed and the flight
          kept getting pushed back then it got cancelled because it was broken. The next plane was leaving literally <span> FIVE </span> hours later
          and they lost my bag because there was "No Time". When I landed in Poland they told me that they lost many suitcases and they had no time to move
          the suitcases. UGH! <span> (At least I can shop now)</span>
        </h3>
        <h3> I got to Poland and Grandma and Viola were waiting for me. Since the plane was late we missed the train back to Bia≈Çystok so we were going to spend the night at Viola's house.
          We had to take two buses to get to Viola's neighborhood and
