<h3> I would like to create a website that is a <b>TV advice column</b></h3>
<h3> It would be in a newspaper format. I would have a horoscope, one or two popular shows, and maybe two
or three pieces of advice about shows that I'm watching now. It might also have one episode of what I'm watching embedded or a link to a show/movie that I like or am watching.</h3>

  "Why do you want to build your website?"
</ul>

<h3> I would like to build this website because I think it would be fun to make and
edit this website. And if I ever decide to publish then I think it would be useful to others.</h3>
