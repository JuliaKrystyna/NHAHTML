<h2> 9️⃣Ninth entry: 4/4/17</h2>
<h3> Today is Sunday <span> also known as God's day</span> and it's also a church related holiday in Poland
<span> zielone świątki</span>. After church Ewa and Basia came and picked us up to go to a festival in Skansen.
There was a playground there and there were these carts almost like old strollers. Basia got in I rode her around a little
then Basia insisted to get her face painted, so she got this big, ugly, mostly black butterfly painted on her cheek.
There were horses where you had to pay to sit on a horse and have some one pull you around. So I said that I didn't want to
go because that isn't what I would consider fun. My grandma told me that I was hurting her feelings but I didn't give in
I thought that I would be hurting the horse more. Basia wanted to go for a ride so she did, and she was happy. We walked
around a little bit more. Whenever we're at one of these festivals she always make it a priority to buy a bunch of food
that we all know she won't need. So this time, wasn't any different, she bought a giant jar of honey even though we have tons
of it at home and grandpa can't eat it, while no one else will even look at it, and of course she had to buy <span> TONS</span>
of meat even though we had meat at home. But it doesn't matter, Basia really wanted to the Dinosaur Park not far from the festival
it was less than 5 minutes away. We got there and then she noticed that the amusement park would way more fun than walking
around staring at a bunch of plastic dinosaurs in the middle of the forest with a bunch of bugs.
