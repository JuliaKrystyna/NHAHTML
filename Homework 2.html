  <h1> Hideaway </h1>
  <h2> by: Kiesza</h2>
  <h3>
    Taking me higher than I've ever been before<br>
    I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more<br>
    You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling<br>
    You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning<br>
    Not even I can't find a way to stop the storm<br>
    Oh, baby, it's out of my control, it's going home<br>
    But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming<br>
    You're just another day that keeps me breathing<br>
    Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure<br>
    Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more!<br>
    Uh, you send me the shiver and the spine might overflow<br>
    You're bringing me closer to the edge, I'm letting go<br>
    You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling<br>
    You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning<br>
    Pulling my head into the clouds I'm floating off<br>
    When you can be going I can't find a way to stop<br>
    You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming<br>
    You're just another day that keeps me breathing<br>
    Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure<br>
    Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more<br>
    Hide away with me some more<br>
    Taking me high up where I've never been before<br>
    I'm holding it back, just one sec, I won't be long<br>
    You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling<br>
    You let my heart escape, beyond the meaning<br>
    Not even I can't find a way to stop the storm<br>
    Oh, baby, it's out of my control, whats going on?<br>
    You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming<br>
    You're just another day that keeps me breathing<br>
    You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming<br>
    Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure<br>
    Baby, don't stop me, hide away with me some more<br>
    Hide away with me some more<br>
