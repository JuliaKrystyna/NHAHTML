<h2> 9Ô∏è‚É£Ninth entry: 4/4/17</h2>
<h3> Today is Sunday <span> also known as God's day</span> and it's also a church related holiday in Poland
<span> zielone ≈õwiƒÖtki</span>. After church Ewa and Basia came and picked us up to go to a festival in Skansen.
There was a playground there and there were these carts almost like old strollers. Basia got in I rode her around a little
then Basia insisted to get her face painted, so she got this big, ugly, mostly black butterfly painted on her cheek.
There were horses where you had to pay to sit on a horse and have some one pull you around. So I said that I didn't want to
go because that isn't what I would consider fun. My grandma told me that I was hurting her feelings but I didn't give in
I thought that I would be hurting the horse more. Basia wanted to go for a ride so she did, and she was happy. We walked
around a little bit more. Whenever we're at one of these festivals she always make it a priority to buy a bunch of food
that we all know she won't need. So this time, wasn't any different, she bought a giant jar of honey even though we have tons
of it at home and grandpa can't eat it, while no one else will even look at it, and of course she had to buy <span> TONS</span>
of meat even though we had meat at home. But it doesn't matter, Basia really wanted to the Dinosaur Park not far from the festival
it was less than 5 minutes away. We got there and then she noticed that the amusement park would way more fun than walking
around staring at a bunch of plastic dinosaurs in the middle of the forest with a bunch of bugs. So we walked around the amusement
park and went on a bunch of rides. While Basia was in this pool playing around on a mini boat that you power by using your arms.
There were two handles that you have to turn to power the boat. She was rowing the around while Ewa and I were standing at the
edge talking. THen this woman with red hair and a boa in her hair comes up to me and looks at me and tells me that there is a
contest happening and if I would want to join. It was a ski race, meaning that there were two teams woth five perople on each
team and we all had our feet tied to the two boards and whichever team go to the bowl first would win a <span> "special prize"</span>.
My team won and each of us got two tickets to any ride in the whole amusement park. So Basia and I used the two tickets to go on
a roller coaster. At first I was scared out of my mind because it was an old rickety roller coaster that went around for
<span> three minutes, 15 rounds </span> But when it stared to move it was a bit better once it started to move. We made it the
whole <span> 3 minutes, 15 rounds </span>.

<h3> This moring Pawe≈Ç <span>(my uncle)</span> came to fix the watering hose that grandpa broke last year. We then had to go to rehab.
It was now the third time at rehab and then we went to the grocery store for some things. While we were waiting for the bus Ela
<span> (my aunt)</span> called and they were actually on their way to our house so they picked us up from the store and dropped us off home.

<h3> Today grandma went to work and woke me up early to tell me that she's leaving and that breakfast is ready. I acknowledged
it but didn't wake up right away. I fell asleep and </h3>
