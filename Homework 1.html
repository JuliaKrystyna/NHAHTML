<u><h1> The Secret Life Of Pets </h1></u>
<tt><h3> The Plot</h3></tt>
<i><h3 class="JuliaK"> This is a movie that follows the story of two dogs that get into a big fight over their owner and end up getting captured by Animal Control,
getting lost in the sewers, getting attacked by an evil bunny and his crew. They're called the Flushed Pets! It's an inspiring movie that tells us that
family always sticks together. Nothing can separate the true bond of family and adventure. </h3></i>
